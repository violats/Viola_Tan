### 1) Problem Definition Skills
<i>(BCG-Rise's Business Essentials Projects - submitted: March 2021)</i>

<b>Project Deliverable:</b> Advise CEO of Apple Inc on Business Strategy <i>(Note: Apple Inc is not a project sponsor.)</i>
 <br><br><b>Resources:</b> Excel spreadsheets of publicly available data (end 2020) of its revenue figures, its sales volume for physical products and its export volume.
 
 <b><i>In essence, given the myriad market Apple is in through its products and services, what should Apple focus on?</i></b>
 
 Our problem definition process could be defined by these 4 stages:<br><br>
 [a) Focusing on important metrics (and not mountains of information)](#a))<br>
 b) Summarising Problem Definition with the Situation-Complication-Potential Questions framework<br>
 c) Ideating better questions with de-constrain methodology and 5 whys<br>
 d) Using Logic Tree as a tool to organise team collaboration and evaluate sector with most impact.
<br><br>
#### a)  <i>Focused on important metrics</i> and not mountains of information
Despite mountains of data, focus was given to important metrics anomalies: eg Excel sheets' (end 2020) <b>data disparity</b> of China's revenue dropping from 2018 to 2020...
<br><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/violats/Viola_Tan/main/images/AppleRegionalRevenue.png" width="350"/>
<br>(Excel chart courtesy of teammate Soh Kiam Boon)
 
 <b>compared against 1st quarter 2021 anomalous revenue rise of 57%</b> called attention. (source: https://www.investopedia.com/how-apple-makes-money-4798689) China's sudden iPad demand due to home-based learning was identified as a driving cause. (https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/Coronavirus/China-demand-for-e-learning-bites-into-Apple-s-iPad-supply)
 
 <b>Within a quarter, Apple's share of revenue from China increased from 10++% to 19%</b>, while its operating income share was 21% of Apple's total operating income.  This leads to....
<br><br> 
#### b) Resulting in clearer problem definition with the Situation-Complication-Potential Questions Summary 
centred on <b>significant increased revenue from China driven by <i>iPad demand</i></b> in 2020 contrasted sharply against its then <i>small market share of mobile phones:</i>
 <br><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/violats/Viola_Tan/main/images/AppleSCQProblemDefinition.png" width="350"/>
<br><br> 
#### c) Further using BCG's suite of tools to drill down into sector
 
 We <b>de-constrained</b> the SCQ questions to create new questions few people thought about.  After evaluating the questions, we decided to analyse the question of <b>"How a user can interract with his/her environment with Apple devices"</b> using a <i>logic tree.</i>
<br><br> 
#### d) Logic Tree as a tool to organise team collaboration for evaluating final sector
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/violats/Viola_Tan/main/images/Logic Tree.png" width="350"/>

My team debated between e-learning vs healthcare sector as the entry point for the longest time but decided on healthcare for 2 reasons:
1) Higher potential growth due to healthcare sector projected to grow to USD$1.1 trillion compared to e-learning's USD$34 billion.
2) More natural progression given Apple Watch's new features launched in Sept 2020 to monitor blood oxygen levels 
<br><br>
#### Reflection of our team's stand
Our stand was to <b>"Break into Health Diagnostics Technology Services starting from China"</b> for Apple. (submitted March 2021)

While we follow most teams' recommendations to focus on wearables and services, we were one of three teams to also recommend a market (China) focus with the other 2 teams recommending Western countries and Emerging Markets.

Our stand wouldn't be rational based solely on Excel sheet data (ended 2020) provided but given the major 57% bounceback in the next quarter from another information source, it showed the huge growth potential in China.

In a later BCG-RISE masterclass on <b>2nd June 2021</b>, "Understanding the Chinese Consumer Post Covid-19" given by an authoritative BCG Managing Director and Partner expert in China domestic market, one point she made was that <b>Healthcare is a major selling/pain point for consumers of products and services,</b> across the board, in <b>China.</b> 

### 2) Storytell Insight with Emotion/Values Skills
