#### Problem Definition Skills
<b>Task:</b> Advise CEO of Apple Inc on Business Strategy (submitted: March 2021.)  <i>(Note: Apple Inc is not a project sponsor.)</i>
 <br><br><b>Resources:</b> Excel spreadsheets of publicly available data (end 2020) of its revenue figures, its sales volume for physical products and its export volume.

Our team initially brought more publicly available research about Apple and divided out the resources to be read and summarised for the whole team's understanding.  This achieved the productive purpose of the team having a baseline understanding of its market, its competitors and the different niches its products fulfill.  
 
What attracted attention was the disparity of the data.  While the excel sheet data (end 2020) showed China's revenue dropping from 2018:
